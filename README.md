# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository demonstrates the 5 SOLID principles using simple Java examples.

Each principle contains:
- ❌ Bad example (violates the principle)
- ✅ Good example (follows the principle)

## Principles Covered
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## How to Use
- Open each package
- Compare `bad` vs `good` implementations
- Run and refactor code yourself
